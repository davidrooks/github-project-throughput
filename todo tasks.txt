Todo:
Store throughput on a specific day using the crob job to run it on that specific day


# Create /api/
# Use those api pages to run the .erb files, perhaps use jquery Fetch to load it?
# The api can then be ran once a night using cron job for data to be stored on a file etc. This file will contain daily data for creating graphs etc
